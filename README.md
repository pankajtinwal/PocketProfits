   Before configuring the bot, you need to obtain the following API keys. (This process is external to Replit):

   *   **Telegram Bot Token**:
      1.  Open Telegram and search for "BotFather".
      2.  Start a chat with BotFather and send the `/newbot` command.
      3.  Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.

      2.  Sign in with your Google account.
      3.  Click on "Get API key" or "Create API key in new project".

**3. Configure Secrets in Replit**
   Replit uses "Secrets" to securely store environment variables. Do **not** create a `.env` file for Replit.
   1.  In your Replit workspace for PocketProfits, look for the "Secrets" tab in the left sidebar (it has a key icon ðŸ”‘).

   3.  Replace the placeholder values with your actual token and keys.

**4. Install Dependencies (if necessary)**
   Replit usually installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` automatically when you first run the Repl or if it detects changes.
   If you need to manually install or update dependencies, open the "Shell" tab in Replit and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
